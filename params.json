Gitlint has sane defaults, but you can also easily customize it to your own liking.\r\n\r\nNote that not all features described below might be available in the latest stable version. Have a look at the\r\n[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for an alternative written in Ruby, have a look at\r\n[fit-commit](https://github.com/m1foley/fit-commit).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started ##\r\n```bash\r\n# Install gitlint\r\npip install gitlint\r\n\r\n# Check the last commit message\r\ngitlint\r\n# Alternatively, pipe a commit message to gitlint:\r\ncat examples/commit-message-1 | gitlint\r\n# or\r\ngit log -1 --pretty=%B | gitlint\r\n\r\n# To install a gitlint as a commit-msg git hook:\r\ngitlint --install-hook\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput example:\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat examples/commit-message-2 | gitlint\r\n1: T1 Title exceeds max length (134>80): \"This is the title of a commit message that \tis over 80 characters and contains hard tabs and trailing whitespace and the word wiping  \"\r\n1: T2 Title has trailing whitespace: \"This is the title of a commit message that \tis over 80 characters and contains hard tabs and trailing whitespace and the word wiping  \"\r\n1: T4 Title contains hard tab characters (\\t): \"This is the title of a commit message that \tis over 80 characters and contains hard tabs and trailing whitespace and the word wiping  \"\r\n2: B4 Second line is not empty: \"This line should not contain text\"\r\n3: B1 Line exceeds max length (125>80): \"Lines typically need to have \ta max length, meaning that they can't exceed a preset number of characters, usually 80 or 120. \"\r\n3: B2 Line has trailing whitespace: \"Lines typically need to have \ta max length, meaning that they can't exceed a preset number of characters, usually 80 or 120. \"\r\n3: B3 Line contains hard tab characters (\\t): \"Lines typically need to have \ta max length, meaning that they can't exceed a preset number of characters, usually 80 or 120. \"\r\n```\r\nNOTE: The returned exit code equals the number of errors found. [Some exit codes are special](README.md#exit-codes).\r\n\r\nYou can modify verbosity using the ```-v``` flag, like so:\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat examples/commit-message-2 | gitlint -v\r\n1: T1\r\n1: T2\r\n[removed output]\r\n$ cat examples/commit-message-2 | gitlint -vv\r\n1: T1 Title exceeds max length (134>80)\r\n1: T2 Title has trailing whitespace\r\n1: T4 Title contains hard tab characters (\\t)\r\n[removed output]\r\n$ cat examples/commit-message-2 | gitlint -vvv\r\n1: T1 Title exceeds max length (134>80): \"This is the title of a commit message that \tis over 80 characters and contains hard tabs and trailing whitespace and the word wiping  \"\r\n1: T2 Title has trailing whitespace: \"This is the title of a commit message that \tis over 80 characters and contains hard tabs and trailing whitespace and the word wiping  \"\r\n[removed output]\r\n```\r\nThe default verbosity is ```-vvv```.\r\n\r\nOther commands and variations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: gitlint [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\n  Git lint tool, checks your git commit messages for styling issues\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --install-hook     Install gitlint as a git commit-msg hook\r\n  --uninstall-hook   Uninstall gitlint commit-msg hook\r\n  -C, --config PATH  Config file location (default: .gitlint).\r\n  -c TEXT            Config flags in format <rule>.<option>=<value> (e.g.: -c\r\n                     T1.line-length=80). Flag can be used multiple times to\r\n                     set multiple config values.\r\n  --ignore TEXT      Ignore rules (comma-separated by id or name).\r\n  -v, --verbose      Verbosity, more v's for more verbose output (e.g.: -v,\r\n                     -vv, -vvv). Default: -vvv\r\n  -s, --silent       Silent mode (no output). Takes precedence over -v, -vv,\r\n                     -vvv.\r\n  --version          Show the version and exit.\r\n  --help             Show this message and exit.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rules ##\r\n\r\nID    | Name                        | Description\r\n------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------\r\nT1    | title-max-length            | Title length must be &lt; 72 chars.\r\nT2    | title-trailing-whitespace   | Title cannot have trailing whitespace (space or tab)\r\nT3    | title-trailing-punctuation  | Title cannot have trailing punctuation (?:!.,;)\r\nT4    | title-hard-tab              | Title cannot contain hard tab characters (\\t)\r\nT5    | title-must-not-contain-word | Title cannot contain certain words (default: \"WIP\")\r\nT6    | title-leading-whitespace    | Title cannot have leading whitespace (space or tab)\r\nT7    | title-match-regex           | Title must match a given regex (default: .*)\r\nB1    | body-max-line-length        | Lines in the body must be &lt; 80 chars\r\nB2    | body-trailing-whitespace    | Body cannot have trailing whitespace (space or tab)\r\nB3    | body-hard-tab               | Body cannot contain hard tab characters (\\t)\r\nB4    | body-first-line-empty       | First line of the body (second line of commit message) must be empty\r\nB5    | body-min-length             | Body length must be at least 20 characters\r\nB6    | body-is-missing             | Body message must be specified\r\nB7    | body-changed-file-mention   | Body must contain references to certain files if those files are changed in the last commit\r\n\r\n## Configuration ##\r\n\r\nYou can modify gitlint's behavior by specifying a config file like so: \r\n```bash\r\ngitlint --config myconfigfile.ini \r\n```\r\nBy default, gitlint will look for an optional ```.gitlint``` config file.\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n# All these sections are optional, edit this file as you like.\r\n[general]\r\nignore=title-trailing-punctuation, T3\r\n# verbosity should be a value between 1 and 3, the commandline -v flags take precedence over\r\n# this\r\nverbosity = 2\r\n\r\n[title-max-length]\r\nline-length=20\r\n\r\n[title-must-not-contain-word]\r\n# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case\r\n# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so \"WIPING\"\r\n# will not cause a violation, but \"WIP: my title\" will.\r\nwords=wip,title\r\n\r\n[title-match-regex]\r\n# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) that the\r\n# commit-msg title must be matched to.\r\n# Note that the regex can contradict with other rules if not used correctly\r\n# (e.g. title-must-not-contain-word).\r\nregex=^US[0-9]*\r\n\r\n[B1]\r\n# B1 = body-max-line-length\r\nline-length=30\r\n\r\n[body-min-length]\r\nmin-length=5\r\n\r\n[body-is-missing]\r\n# Whether to ignore this rule on merge commits (which typically only have a title)\r\n# default = True\r\nignore-merge-commits=false\r\n\r\n[body-changed-file-mention]\r\n# List of files that need to be explicitly mentioned in the body when they are changed\r\n# This is useful for when developers often erroneously edit certain files or git submodules.\r\n# By specifying this rule, developers can only change the file when they explicitly reference\r\n# it in the commit message.\r\nfiles=gitlint/rules.py,README.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use one or more ```-c``` flags like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gitlint -c general.verbosity=2 -c title-max-length.line-length=80 -c B1.line-length=100\r\n```\r\nThe generic config flag format is ```-c <rule>.<option>=<value>``` and supports all the same rules and options which \r\nyou can also use in a ```.gitlint``` config file.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can also disable gitlint for specific commit messages by adding ```gitlint-ignore: all``` to the commit\r\nmessage like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWIP: This is my commit message\r\n\r\nI want gitlint to ignore this entire commit message.\r\ngitlint-ignore: all\r\n```\r\n\r\n```gitlint-ignore: all``` can occur on any line, as long as it is at the start of the line. You can also specify\r\nspecific rules to be ignored as follows: ```gitlint-ignore: T1, body-hard-tab```.\r\n\r\n### Config precedence ###\r\nConfiguring gitlint happens the following order of precedence:\r\n\r\n1. Commit specific config (e.g.: ```gitlint-ignore: all``` in the commit message) \r\n2. Commandline convenience flags (e.g.:  ```-vv```, ```--silent```, ```--ignore```)\r\n3. Commandline configuration flags (e.g.: ```-c title-max-length=123```)\r\n4. Configuration file (local ```.gitlint``` file, or file specified using ```-C```/```--config```)\r\n5. Default gitlint config\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using gitlint as a commit-msg hook ##\r\nYou can also install gitlint as a git ```commit-msg``` hook so that gitlint checks your commit messages automatically\r\nafter each commit.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngitlint --install-hook\r\n# To remove the hook\r\ngitlint --uninstall-hook\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportant: Gitlint cannot work together with an existing hook. If you already have a ```.git/hooks/commit-msg```\r\nfile in your local repository, gitlint will refuse to install the ```commit-msg``` hook. gitlint will also only\r\nuninstall unmodified commit-msg hooks that were installed by gitlint.\r\n\r\n## Exit codes ##\r\nGitlint uses the exit code as a simple way to indicate the number of violations found.\r\nSome exit codes are used to indicate special errors as indicated in the table below.\r\n\r\nBecause of these special error codes and the fact that\r\n[bash only supports exit codes between 0 and 255](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html), the maximum number\r\nof violations counted by the exit code is 252. Note that gitlint does not have a limit on the number of violations\r\nit can detect, it will just always return with exit code 252 when the number of violations is greater than or equal\r\nto 252.\r\n\r\nExit Code  | Description\r\n-----------|------------------------------------------------------------\r\n253        | Wrong invocation of the ```gitlint``` command.\r\n254        | Something went wrong when invoking git.\r\n255        | Invalid gitlint configuration\r\n\r\n## Contributing ##\r\n\r\nWe'd love for you to contribute to gitlint. Just open a pull request and we'll get right on it! \r\nYou can find a wishlist below, but we're open to any suggestions you might have!\r\n\r\n### Development ###\r\n\r\nThere is a Vagrantfile in this repository that can be used for development.\r\n```bash\r\nvagrant up\r\nvagrant ssh\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can choose to use your local environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nvirtualenv .venv\r\npip install -r requirements.txt -r test-requirements.txt\r\npython setup.py develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run tests:\r\n```bash\r\n./run_tests.sh                       # run unit tests and print test coverage\r\n./run_tests.sh --no-coverage         # run unit tests without test coverage\r\n./run_tests.sh --pep8                # pep8 checks\r\n./run_tests.sh --stats               # print some code stats\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see the package description in HTML format\r\n```\r\npip install docutils\r\nexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\r\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8\r\npython setup.py --long-description | rst2html.py > output.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Wishlist ##\r\n- More rules: \r\n    - Checkbox rules: Developers must add a line to the end of the commit specifying that they've considered\r\n      a number of aspects when committing the code. E.g.: ```gitlint-checks: tests, documentation```.\r\n      This can be useful as a reminder if developers often submit code without updating the documentation or tests.\r\n    - max-lines-change: Maximum lines of change in a single commit (-1 = unlimited)\r\n    - Rules for different attributes of the the commit message: author, date, etc\r\n- More rule options:\r\n    - title-must-not-contain-word: case sensitive match\r\n    - title-trailing-punctuation: define punctuation\r\n- Rule improvements:\r\n    - body-changed-file-mention: list all files/directories that need to be mentioned as part of the violation\r\n    - body-changed-file-mention: distinction between change file and directory in output\r\n- Git hooks:\r\n    - appending to an existing hook (after user confirmation)\r\n- Reporting:\r\n    - ```--summary``` option: print out a summary at the end. Contains: number/type or errors\r\n    - ```--count``` option: only print out the number of violations\r\n    - ```--report```: html report\r\n- Configuration\r\n    - Work on a different git repo than the current directory: ```--target``` parameter.\r\n- Documentation \r\n    - Documentation site on ```gh-pages``` branch using Jekyll\r\n    - Create demo using [https://asciinema.org/]()\r\n- Developer convenience:\r\n    - More unit tests, always more unit tests\r\n    - Integration tests\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
